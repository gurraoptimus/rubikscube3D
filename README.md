# 3D Rubik's Cube Visualization in Python

## Project Description
This Python project creates a 3D visualization of a Rubik's Cube using **PyOpenGL** and **Pygame**. The cube rotates continuously in a 3D space, providing a simple visual representation of a Rubik's Cube. The program opens in a new window with the cube rendered in 3D and continuously rotating.

## Features
- 3D rendering of a Rubik's Cube using OpenGL
- Continuously rotating view to simulate cube rotation
- Real-time visualization in a separate window

## Prerequisites
You need to install **Pygame** and **PyOpenGL** libraries. You can install them via `pip` as follows:

```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL
